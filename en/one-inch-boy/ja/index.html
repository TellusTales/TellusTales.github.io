Issun-Bōshi, however, asked his mother for a bowl, a chopstick, and a needle. Using the bowl as a boat, and the chopstick as a paddle, he made his way to the Island. In a dark cave, Issun-Bōshi found the girl in a cage, guarded by the giant red ogre. The boy approached the ogre and said “Ogre! I challenge you to a fight!

Angry, the ogre tried to squash the boy with his hand, but at the last moment, Issun-Bōshi raised his sword and the ogre stabbed himself instead. Whilst the ogre fell back in pain, the one-inch boy ran up the ogre’s red hand. He ran past the ogre’s elbow, past the shoulder, past the sharp tusks, and onto the ogre’s nose. In one fell swoop slashed both the ogre’s giant red eyes, blinding the ogre. The ogre, now fearing the boy, clumsily ran out of the cave.</p></td>
